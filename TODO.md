# TODO

## Backlog

_Derived from `SPEC.md`. Finished tasks move to `CHANGELOG.md`._

- [ ] Re-enable the real ArcGIS SDK OAuth Preview E2E once the example tutorial UI has stabilized.
- [ ] Self-host the Calcite assets actually used (t9n `en` + used icons) so "serve locally" works without network (the full CDN asset folder is 27 MB / 6.8k files).
- [ ] `create-interactive-code-scroll` scaffolder wizard (2.3; rules in `SPEC.md`, commit order in the plan's 2.3 plan-mode pass).
- [ ] ArcGIS starters as scaffolder templates (`arcgis-js`, `arcgis-rest`, `arcgis-python`, `arcgis-kotlin`), after 2.3.
- [ ] `interactive-code-scroll add`: add a tutorial to an existing project (single → series conversion included).
- [ ] Review with Calcite experts whether `calcite-shell` / `calcite-shell-panel` could replace the page grid (`div.layout`); requirements in PROJECT.md "Page layout".
- [ ] Publish the "OAuth PKCE with ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript" tutorial.

## Multi-SDK support

_Plan: `docs/research/arcgis-multi-sdk-plan.md`. Update `SPEC.md` before implementing each phase._

Phase 1 — REST vertical slice (cURL / Python / JavaScript): done, go/no-go GO (2026-09-30). Next: Phase 2; 2.1 multi-tutorial repos, 2.2 shared credentials, 2.5 sibling tutorials and 2.4 Pages workflow are done; next 2.3 (plan).
