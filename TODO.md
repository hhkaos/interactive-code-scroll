## Backlog

_Derived from `SPEC.md`. Finished tasks move to `CHANGELOG.md`._

- [ ] Re-enable the real ArcGIS SDK OAuth Preview E2E once the example tutorial UI has stabilized.
- [ ] Self-host the Calcite assets actually used (t9n `en` + used icons) so "serve locally" works without network (the full CDN asset folder is 27 MB / 6.8k files).
- [ ] `pnpm create interactive-code-scroll` scaffolder.
- [ ] GitHub Pages workflow for a series site (2.4).
- [ ] Sibling tutorials: frontmatter `family` + `familyLabel`, header switcher that navigates to the same step id in the chosen tutorial (needs multi-tutorial repos).
- [ ] Review with Calcite experts whether `calcite-shell` / `calcite-shell-panel` could replace the page grid (`div.layout`); requirements in PROJECT.md "Page layout".
- [ ] Publish the "OAuth PKCE with ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript" tutorial.

## Multi-SDK support

_Plan: `docs/research/arcgis-multi-sdk-plan.md`. Update `SPEC.md` before implementing each phase._

Phase 1 — REST vertical slice (cURL / Python / JavaScript): done, go/no-go GO (2026-09-30). Next: Phase 2; 2.1 multi-tutorial repos is done, then 2.2 → 2.5 → 2.4 → 2.3 (plan).
